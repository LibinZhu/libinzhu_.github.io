I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Mikhail Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). Prior to UCSD, I received my BS in Mathematics from Zhejiang University. 

I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Recently, I have been focusing on understanding the optimization and generalization of neural networks. I am particularly interested in the behaviors of neural networks with large learning rates, where the Neural Tangent Kernel is no longer constant and feature learning may emerge.
