I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Mikhail Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). Prior to UCSD, I received my BS in Mathematics from Zhejiang University. 

I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning. Recently, I have been focusing on understanding the optimization and generalization of wide neural networks.   One of the interesting questions is *"Can Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) answer the mystery of neural networks?"*  If not, how to interpret the feature learning in neural networks?
